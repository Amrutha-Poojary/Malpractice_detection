# Malpractice_detection
This project detects suspicious activities during an exam using a trained deep learning model. The system captures real-time webcam footage, processes it, and classifies the detected gestures as either Suspicious or Non-Suspicious based on the trained model.
# Features
Real-time gesture recognition using OpenCV

Deep learning-based classification with TensorFlow/Keras

Live prediction overlay on webcam feed

Customizable model for different scenarios
# How it Works
Captures frames from the webcam.

Resizes and normalizes them for the model.

Feeds them into a pre-trained neural network.

Displays the classification result on the screen.
